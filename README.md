# NovaSurvivalGames
Our implementation of the game SurvivalGames!

Requires [NovaCore and NovaCore Game Engine](https://github.com/NovaUniverse/NovaCore) to run and also requires a custom loader plugin handling starting the game and setting up the game lobby that you will have to write yourself.

For development/testing purposes you can use [NovaGameSDK](https://github.com/NovaUniverse/NovaGameSDK) to set up a minimal dev server
